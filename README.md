## Blockly-gamepad 🎮



## How it works 📘

This library helps you to create the Blockly structure of a game, allowing you to interact `asynchronously` with it using methods like `load()` & `reset()` to init the game, `play()` & `pause()` to start the game, `forward()` & `backward()` to move step-by-step through the blocks and others useful methods.

## Tips 💡

To get a `quick` feedback of what you can create with this library I suggest you to view both the `demo` and the `games` linked above.
I also advise you to view the `commented` code (both for games and for the demo).
